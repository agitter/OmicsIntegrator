        When the solver is constrained by depth, it still picks up net positive nodes.
          This results in a different network than if the solver is not constrained by depth.

        Note behavior of the following tests for comparison (which we do not repeat in this class):
          TestW#test_w_1, which has w = 1 and D = 5
            we are not constrained by depth and we pick A - C -> D
          TestDepth#test_depth_10, which has w = 0 and D = 10
            there is no forest penalty, so the optimal network is the same as this one
